This folder provides different simulations of spatially resolved graph-ODE (or metapopulation) models
using one ODE model for each county and realizing inter-county mobility via a graph approach.

- 2020_npis_wildtype: Focus on a SECIR model using parameters for Sars-CoV-2 wild type variant and
implementing static nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as well as dynamic NPIs. Dynamic NPIs
get into play once predefined incidence thresholds (50 and 200) are exceeded.

- 2021_vaccination_delta: Extending the model of 2020_npis_wildtype by vaccination and reinfection and
considering the effect of vaccination in combination with the lifting of NPIs during the arrival of Delta.

The data which is necessary to run these simulations is generated by the MEmilio epidata package.
A simple generation is possible with the script `data_generation.sh`.
