# Simple SECIR model 

This model is an very simplified application of the SECIR model implemented `here <https://github.com/DLR-SC/memilio/tree/main/cpp/models/ode_secir/readme.md>`_.
The Example based on `this python file <https://github.com/DLR-SC/memilio/blob/main/pycode/examples/simulation/secir_simple.py>`_. which uses python bindings to run the c++ code there.
